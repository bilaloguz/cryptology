TURKISH ALPHABET FIXES - SUMMARY
=================================

COMPLETED FIXES:
✅ Vigenère - Fixed parameter order (alphabet before table)
✅ Beaufort - Fixed parameter order (alphabet before table)  
✅ Auto-key - Fixed parameter order (alphabet before table)
✅ ROT13 - Fixed to use shift=13 (not half alphabet length)
✅ Playfair - Made square size dynamic (5x5 or 6x6)

REMAINING ISSUES:
❌ Playfair (Turkish) - Still failing in full test suite
❌ Bifid (Turkish) - Not yet fixed
❌ Trifid (ALL) - Known algorithmic issue (deferred)
❌ Columnar (Turkish Extended) - UTF-8 issue

CURRENT STATUS: 34/42 (81% passing)

WORKS IN ALL ALPHABETS:
- Caesar, Atbash, Keyword, Affine
- ROT13 (now fixed)
- Vigenère, Beaufort, Auto-key (now fixed)

NOTES:
- Don't replace Turkish characters in any cipher
- Use dynamic square sizes (5x5 or 6x6) based on alphabet
- For odd-length padding, use characters that exist in the square
